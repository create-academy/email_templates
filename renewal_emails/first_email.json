        "description": "<div>Designed for complete beginners, Freya covers all the key materials and tools needed to start creating pottery at home, before introducing two projects to practice different techniques. Beginning with a small ceramic pinch bowl, Freya shows how to work the clay by hand into different forms before progressing to a larger ceramic flower vase, made using the coiled technique; a method used to create larger pieces without the need for a potter's wheel. The final lessons focus on different ceramic finishes, showing how to paint and varnish final pieces which are all air dried at home, so no professional kiln is needed.</div>",
